The moment someone joins your community, Skool fires an auto DM to their inbox. They just made a decision. They’re paying attention. That message sets the tone for everything that follows.

The auto DM is a plugin you activate in your community settings under “Auto DM new members.” It requires a Skool Pro subscription. Once it’s on, every new member gets your message automatically, no manual outreach needed.

Most operators send a generic “welcome, glad you’re here” and move on. That’s leaving a lot on the table.

This is the one message guaranteed to be read. Open rates on auto DMs are higher than any email you’ll ever send, because the person just joined and they’re looking for a signal about what to do next. You have their full attention for about 60 seconds. A good message turns that into a reply, an action, or a conversion. A bad one gets ignored and the member drifts.

You can browse 44 templates, filter by type, and copy the exact message that fits your community at the [Skool Auto DM Templates tool](/tools/skool-auto-dm-templates).

There are four types of auto DM worth knowing about. Pick the one that matches how your community works.

---

## 1. Start a Conversation

**Goal:** get a reply.

This is the highest-engagement option. Ask a direct question the member can answer in one sentence. The reply opens a real thread, and you learn something useful about who just joined.

> Hey #NAME#! Welcome to #GROUPNAME#! What made you decide to join today?

Or go deeper:

> Hey #NAME#, welcome to #GROUPNAME#! I ask every new member the same question, what does winning look like for you 6 months from now? Your answer helps me make sure you get the most out of being here 👊

“What made you decide to join?” gives you intel on what’s working in your marketing. “What does winning look like?” gives you intel on what the member actually needs. Both are useful. Pick based on what you want to know.

**Best for:** paid communities, coaching-focused groups, any operator who reads their DMs and responds personally.

## 2. Drive to a Link

**Goal:** get them into your onboarding content before they disappear.

A new member who doesn’t take a first action within 24 hours rarely engages later. A link DM removes the friction. Tell them exactly where to go and why it matters.

> Hey #NAME#! Welcome to #GROUPNAME#! Head here first to get started 👉 [LINK] See you on the inside!

Or with more context:

> Hey #NAME#! Welcome to #GROUPNAME# 🎉
>
> Here’s what I want you to do first.
>
> Head to the Start Here post 👉 [LINK]
>
> It’ll show you exactly how everything works so you can hit the ground running instead of feeling lost.
>
> Then come back here and tell me the one thing you most want to get out of being here. I read every single reply 😊

**Best for:** course-heavy communities, communities with a structured onboarding module, any situation where self-service reduces support questions.

## 3. Drive Referrals

**Goal:** grow the community through word of mouth.

Ask on day one, while the joining energy is fresh. People are most likely to share right after they’ve made a decision, not a month later when the novelty has worn off.

> Hey #NAME#! Welcome to #GROUPNAME#! Quick question, is there anyone in your world who should be in here with you?

Or make it feel like a no-brainer:

> #NAME#! Welcome 🎉 Fun fact, members who join with a friend get 3x the results. Anyone come to mind?

Keep it casual. This works because it’s a question, not a pitch.

**Best for:** free communities, communities with strong social proof, operators who want organic growth without ad spend.

---

## 4. Offer Upgrade

**Goal:** convert free members to paid.

This one is for freemium communities. The person just joined your free tier. They’re interested enough to sign up, which means they’re the right audience for the upgrade. Get the offer in front of them immediately, before they settle into free.

> #NAME#! Welcome 🎉 You’re on the free plan right now but if you want access to [PREMIUM BENEFIT] you can upgrade here 👉 [LINK] Either way, glad to have you!

Or a longer version that explains the difference:

> Hey #NAME#, welcome to #GROUPNAME#! You’re starting on the free plan which is a great place to get a feel for things. When you’re ready to go deeper, our premium members get access to [BENEFIT 1], [BENEFIT 2], and [BENEFIT 3]. You can upgrade anytime here 👉 [LINK] Let me know if you have any questions!

Don’t oversell it. State the benefit, drop the link, move on. Most free members won’t upgrade on day one. A small percentage will, and those are your best members.

**Best for:** freemium communities where you’re running Meta ads at $2-$10 CPL. Every 1% improvement in free-to-paid conversion rate changes your break-even significantly. Use the [Skool Freemium Calculator](/tools/skool-freemium-calculator) to see exactly what that number means for your model.

## Which One Should You Use?

**Paid community:** Start a Conversation or Drive to a Link. The first 72 hours decide whether a trial member converts or churns. You need them active fast.

**Freemium community:** Offer Upgrade. The economics only work if a meaningful slice of free members convert. Make the upgrade visible from day one.

**Free community (organic or ad-driven):** Drive Referrals. It costs nothing and the timing is right.
